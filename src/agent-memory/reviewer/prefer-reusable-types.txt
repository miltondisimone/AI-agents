❌ Do not redefine types or interfaces that already exist.

Why:
- Causes duplication and inconsistency
- Makes refactoring harder

✅ Prefer reusing shared types:

interface Todo {
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

const TodoItem = ({ title, completed }: Todo) => {
  return <li>{title}</li>;
};
