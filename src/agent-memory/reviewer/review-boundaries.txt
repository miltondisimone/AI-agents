❌ Avoid making suggestions unrelated to the task or memory examples.

Do NOT suggest:
- Replacing camelCase with kebab-case (this is incorrect in JSX)
- Moving hardcoded data to external files unless requested
- Changing styling systems (e.g., to CSS files or styled-components)
- Adding tests unless the task includes testing

✅ Focus only on:
- Violations of internal memory standards
- Accessibility issues
- Code clarity, reuse, and structure
- React + TypeScript best practices already taught
- Do not mention kebab-case unless it actually appears in the code
